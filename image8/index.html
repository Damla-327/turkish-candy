        <!-- <p class="response"> THE STORY: Akide candy and Turkish delight are two of the most important culinary
                heritages of Turkey. Akide
                candy was invented in 16th century at a time when sugar was very expensive and more valuable than honey.
                The
                word “akide” comes from Arabic and means “faith and loyalty.” In Syrian Arabic dialect, it means
                “thickening, making a knot.” Therefore the candy that is made by boiling honey or sugar took on the name
                “akide.”

                Later on, akide’s alternative meanings; faith and loyalty were picked up and akide candy took on a
                symbolic
                meaning. The janissary army would go to the place every 3 months to receive their salary, which was held
                in
                a ceremonial manner. The highest ranking janissary officers would offer this candy to the Grand Vizier
                and
                other dignitaries to symbolize their loyalty to the state and the sultan. It also became a tradition to
                offer akide candy to the members of the Imperial Council after the morning prayers every Tuesday, and
                akide
                candy became an important part of every type of social and religious celebrations as well as weddings
                and
                circumcision ceremonies. </p><br> -->
